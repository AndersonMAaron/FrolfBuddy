FrolfBuddy
==========

FrolfBuddy is a proof-of-concept Java application centered around 3 features:
  1.) Recommends a disc golf disc based on the discs you currently own
  2.) Displays a user-interactable scorecard to keep track of a current round
  3.) Tracks lifetime statistics associated to your profile 
  

The `main` package contains the runnable classes, and package `main.gui` contains the user interfaces for the app.
